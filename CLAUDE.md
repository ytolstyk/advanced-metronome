# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (Vite + HMR)
npm run build    # Type-check + production build (tsc -b && vite build)
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
npm run preview  # Preview production build locally
npm run type-check  # tsc --noEmit only
```

No test framework is configured yet.

## Architecture

Two-screen app (React Router) with a shared `<Nav>` rendered in `src/main.tsx`:
- `/` — Drum machine (`src/App.tsx`)
- `/tuner` — Guitar tuner (`src/pages/TunerPage.tsx`)

Entry point: `index.html` → `src/main.tsx`.

- **Build:** ES2022 target, ESNext modules, bundler module resolution
- **JSX:** Automatic transform (react-jsx), no React import needed
- **Lint:** ESLint 9.x flat config with TypeScript, react-hooks, react-refresh plugins
- **CSS:** Tailwind CSS v4 (via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin) + vanilla CSS for domain-specific components. Each component has a co-located `.css` file; page-level styles live in `src/App.css` or their own `src/pages/*.css`.
- **UI components:** shadcn/ui (New York style) — reusable primitives in `src/components/ui/` (Button, Input, Label, Slider, Select, ToggleGroup). Uses Radix UI primitives, `class-variance-authority`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`.
- **Path alias:** `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (configured in `tsconfig.app.json` + `vite.config.ts`)

## Drum machine state

All drum machine state lives in `App.tsx` via `useReducer`. The pure reducer and `Action` union type are in `src/state.ts`. Types are in `src/types.ts`:

- `Pattern = Record<InstrumentId, boolean[]>` — per-instrument beat grid
- `AppState` — config (measures, bpm, loopCount), pattern, playback state
- 7 instruments: kick, snare, hihat, openhat, clap, rim, tom

Dispatch is passed as props to all components — no external state library. `config` + `pattern` are persisted to `localStorage` on every change (`saveState` in `src/state.ts`).

Undo history is managed in `App.tsx` with a ref-based stack (not in the reducer). `volume` and `humanize` are local `useState` in `App.tsx` (not persisted, not in the reducer).

## Audio engine (drum machine)

Class-based `AudioEngine` in `src/audio/AudioEngine.ts`, held in a `useRef` via `useAudioEngine` hook. Uses Web Audio lookahead scheduling (25ms `setInterval`, 100ms lookahead).

Drum sounds are fire-and-forget synthesis in `src/audio/drumSynths.ts`. Each synth accepts `(ctx, dest, time, vel?, pitch?)` — `dest` is the engine's master `GainNode` (for volume control), not `ctx.destination` directly. `exportAudio.ts` passes `offlineCtx.destination` instead so WAV export is always at full volume.

`useAudioEngine` hook (`src/hooks/useAudioEngine.ts`) bridges the engine to React — it accepts `humanize` (0–100) and `volume` (0–1) and syncs them to the engine via `useEffect`. During playback, `updateConfig()` live-patches BPM, pattern, and loop count without restarting.

## Guitar tuner

Self-contained in `src/pages/TunerPage.tsx` + `TunerPage.css`. No shared state with the drum machine. Uses the McLeod Pitch Method (NSDF autocorrelation) on mic input via `getUserMedia` + `AnalyserNode` (fftSize 4096). Runs at ~20fps (every 3rd RAF frame) with a 5-frame median filter for stability. Displays a vertical meter: cursor moves up when sharp, down when flat.

## TypeScript strictness

Strict mode enabled. Notable settings in `tsconfig.app.json`:

- `erasableSyntaxOnly` — no enums or namespaces
- `verbatimModuleSyntax` — must use `import type` for type-only imports
- `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`

## Key design decisions

- **Mixed time signatures:** each measure can have a different time signature; pattern arrays are resized/remapped on structural changes
- **Live editing during playback:** BPM, pattern toggles, and loop count update in real-time via `updateConfig()`; structural changes (measure count, time signatures) stop playback
- **DrumSynth dest param:** all synths route through a master GainNode — always pass `dest` not `ctx.destination`
- **WAV export:** uses `OfflineAudioContext` in `exportAudio.ts`, bypasses the master GainNode

## Validations

Make sure all these checks pass before accepting changes:

1. **Lint** `npm run lint`
2. **Types** `npm run type-check`
3. **Build** `npm run build`
